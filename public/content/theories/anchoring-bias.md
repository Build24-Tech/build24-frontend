# Anchoring Bias

Anchoring bias is a cognitive bias that describes the common human tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered (the "anchor") when making decisions. This psychological phenomenon significantly influences how people process subsequent information and make judgments. In product development and marketing, understanding anchoring bias can help you strategically position your offerings and guide user decision-making processes. The bias occurs because our brains use the initial information as a reference point, and all subsequent evaluations are made relative to this anchor, even when the anchor is completely irrelevant to the decision at hand.

## How to Apply in Build24

When building products or marketing campaigns, you can leverage anchoring bias to influence user perceptions and decisions. Start by presenting a higher-priced option or premium feature set first, which serves as an anchor that makes your standard offering appear more reasonable and valuable. In pricing strategies, display your most expensive plan prominently before showing cheaper alternatives. For landing pages, lead with your strongest value proposition or most impressive statistic to anchor visitors' expectations positively. In user interfaces, present the most important or desired action first to anchor user attention and increase conversion rates.

## Examples and Applications

- **Pricing Pages**: Show premium plans first to make standard plans seem affordable
- **Product Features**: Highlight advanced capabilities before basic ones
- **Landing Page Headlines**: Lead with your strongest value proposition
- **Negotiation**: Start with higher initial offers in B2B sales
- **User Onboarding**: Present premium features first to anchor expectations

This theory connects to other psychological principles like the contrast effect, loss aversion, and social proof. Understanding how anchoring works alongside these other biases can create more effective user experiences and marketing strategies.
