# Social Proof

Social proof is the psychological phenomenon where people look to the behavior and actions of others to guide their own decisions, especially in uncertain situations. This bias stems from our evolutionary need to fit in with the group for survival and safety. When we're unsure about what to do, we assume that others have more information than we do and follow their lead. Social proof is particularly powerful in digital environments where trust signals are crucial for conversion and engagement.
