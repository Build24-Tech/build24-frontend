# Loss Aversion

Loss aversion is a cognitive bias where people feel the pain of losing something more acutely than the pleasure of gaining something of equal value. Research shows that losses are psychologically twice as powerful as gains. This bias influences decision-making across all areas of life and business. People will go to great lengths to avoid losses, even when the potential gains outweigh the risks. Understanding loss aversion helps explain why people stick with the status quo, resist change, and respond strongly to risk-framed messaging.

## How to Apply in Build24

Frame your value propositions in terms of what customers might lose by not taking action, rather than just what they'll gain. Highlight the cost of inaction or the risks of staying with current solutions. Use trial periods and money-back guarantees to reduce perceived risk. Emphasize what customers currently have that they could lose, then position your solution as protection. In pricing, show what users lose access to when downgrading plans. Create urgency by highlighting limited-time opportunities that will be lost.

## Examples and Applications

- Risk-focused messaging ("Don't lose customers to competitors")
- Money-back guarantees to reduce perceived risk
- Free trials that create ownership before purchase
- Highlighting costs of current problems
- Limited-time offers that expire
