# Scarcity Principle

The scarcity principle is a psychological bias where people place higher value on things that are rare or in limited supply. This cognitive shortcut evolved as a survival mechanism - scarce resources were often more valuable for survival. In modern contexts, scarcity creates urgency and can significantly increase perceived value and desirability. The principle works because scarcity triggers loss aversion, making people fear missing out on an opportunity. When something becomes less available, we tend to want it more, even if our actual need for it hasn't changed.

## How to Apply in Build24

Implement scarcity in your products through limited-time offers, exclusive access, or quantity limitations. Use countdown timers for sales or product launches to create urgency. Highlight when items are running low in stock or when spots are filling up for services. Create exclusive tiers or early access programs for loyal customers. However, use scarcity ethically - false scarcity can damage trust and brand reputation. Make sure your scarcity claims are genuine and transparent.

## Examples and Applications

- Limited-time offers with countdown timers
- Early bird pricing for courses or events
- Exclusive beta access for new features
