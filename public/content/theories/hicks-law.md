# Hick's Law

Hick's Law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases logarithmically with the number of choices available. Also known as the Hick-Hyman Law, it describes the relationship between the number of options and the time required to choose among them. While having some choice is important for user satisfaction, too many options can lead to decision paralysis and decreased conversion rates. The law applies to both simple interface decisions and complex product choices.

## How to Apply in Build24

Reduce the number of choices presented to users at any given time. Use progressive disclosure to reveal options gradually rather than overwhelming users with everything at once. Group related options together to make choices feel more manageable. Implement smart defaults to reduce the cognitive load of decision-making. For complex products, use guided flows or wizards that break decisions into smaller, sequential steps. Consider using filters and search to help users narrow down options quickly.

## Examples and Applications

- Simplified navigation menus with clear categories
- Progressive onboarding that reveals features gradually
- Product configurators with step-by-step choices
- Smart defaults in forms and settings
- Filtering systems for large product catalogs
