# Endowment Effect

The endowment effect is a cognitive bias where people value things more highly simply because they own them. Once we possess something, we become emotionally attached to it and overvalue it compared to identical items we don't own. This effect is closely related to loss aversion - we don't want to give up what we already have. The endowment effect explains why free trials are so effective and why people resist switching from products they currently use, even when better alternatives exist.

## How to Apply in Build24

Create ownership experiences before asking for purchase decisions. Offer free trials that let users experience your product as if they own it. Use language that implies ownership ("your dashboard," "your data," "your results"). Allow customization and personalization to increase psychological ownership. Provide setup assistance to help users invest time and effort in your product. Once users have invested in setup and customization, they'll be more reluctant to switch to competitors.

## Examples and Applications

- Free trials with full feature access
- Customizable dashboards and interfaces
- Onboarding that requires user input and setup
- Personalized recommendations and content
- User-generated content and profiles

## Related Concepts
