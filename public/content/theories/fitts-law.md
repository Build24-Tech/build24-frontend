# Fitts' Law

Fitts' Law is a predictive model that describes the time required to rapidly move to a target area, such as clicking a button or selecting a menu item. The law states that the time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target. Larger targets that are closer to the user's current position can be acquired faster than smaller, more distant targets. This principle is fundamental to interface design and directly impacts user experience and conversion rates.

## How to Apply in Build24

Make important interactive elements larger and position them closer to where users are likely to be looking or clicking. Place primary call-to-action buttons prominently and make them sufficiently large for easy clicking. Position related actions near each other to reduce mouse travel time. Use the edges and corners of screens effectively, as they provide infinite width or height for targeting. Consider the user's likely path through your interface and optimize the placement of sequential actions.

## Examples and Applications

- Large, prominent call-to-action buttons
- Navigation menus positioned at screen edges
- Related actions grouped together
- Mobile interfaces with thumb-friendly button placement
- Dropdown menus that appear near the trigger element

This theory connects to other psychological principles like Hick's Law, visual hierarchy, user interface design. Understanding how these concepts work together can create more effective user experiences and marketing strategies.
