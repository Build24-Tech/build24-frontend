# Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)

Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is the anxiety that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent. This social anxiety is characterized by a desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing. FOMO is amplified by social media and digital connectivity, where we constantly see curated highlights of others' experiences. In marketing and product design, FOMO can be a powerful motivator for action, driving urgency and engagement.

## How to Apply in Build24

Create genuine urgency through limited-time offers, exclusive access, or capacity constraints. Share real-time activity and social proof to show what others are experiencing. Use countdown timers and progress indicators to visualize scarcity. Highlight exclusive benefits for early adopters or premium members. Share success stories and user-generated content to show the experiences others are having. However, ensure your FOMO tactics are ethical and based on real limitations rather than artificial scarcity.

## Examples and Applications
