# Emotional Contagion

Emotional contagion is the phenomenon where people unconsciously mimic and synchronize with the emotions of others around them. This automatic process happens through facial expressions, vocal tones, postures, and movements. In digital environments, emotional contagion occurs through visual design, copy tone, user-generated content, and social interactions. Understanding emotional contagion helps create experiences that evoke desired emotional responses and build stronger connections with users.
