# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Rapid MVP Builder feature enables developers to quickly transform validated product ideas into functional minimum viable products (MVPs) within Build24's signature 24-hour development sprints. This feature bridges the gap between product planning (from the Launch Essentials framework) and actual implementation, providing automated scaffolding, pre-built components, and deployment pipelines that align with modern development practices. The feature emphasizes speed without sacrificing code quality, enabling developers to focus on unique business logic rather than boilerplate setup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated project scaffolding based on my product requirements, so that I can start building immediately without spending time on initial setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer selects a project template THEN the system SHALL generate a complete project structure with all necessary configuration files
2. WHEN choosing a technology stack THEN the system SHALL automatically configure build tools, linting, testing frameworks, and deployment scripts
3. WHEN integrating with external services THEN the system SHALL provide pre-configured API clients and authentication setups
4. IF the developer has completed Launch Essentials validation THEN the system SHALL pre-populate project metadata and configuration based on validated requirements
5. WHEN scaffolding is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a working development environment with hot reload and debugging capabilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a library of pre-built, customizable components, so that I can rapidly assemble user interfaces without building everything from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browsing the component library THEN the system SHALL categorize components by functionality (auth, data display, forms, navigation, etc.)
2. WHEN selecting a component THEN the system SHALL show live previews with customization options and code examples
3. WHEN customizing components THEN the system SHALL provide visual editors for styling, behavior, and data binding
4. WHEN adding components to a project THEN the system SHALL automatically handle dependencies and integration requirements
5. IF components have breaking changes THEN the system SHALL provide migration guides and automated update tools

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent code generation based on data models, so that I can quickly create CRUD operations and API endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining data models THEN the system SHALL generate TypeScript interfaces, validation schemas, and database migrations
2. WHEN creating API endpoints THEN the system SHALL generate RESTful routes with proper error handling and validation
3. WHEN building user interfaces THEN the system SHALL generate forms, tables, and detail views based on data model schemas
4. WHEN implementing authentication THEN the system SHALL generate login, registration, and protected route components
5. IF data models change THEN the system SHALL update all related generated code while preserving custom modifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integrated deployment and hosting solutions, so that I can deploy my MVP with minimal configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ready to deploy THEN the system SHALL provide one-click deployment to multiple platforms (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.)
2. WHEN configuring deployment THEN the system SHALL automatically set up environment variables, build scripts, and CI/CD pipelines
3. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL provide staging environments and rollback capabilities
4. WHEN monitoring the deployed application THEN the system SHALL integrate basic analytics and error tracking
5. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs and suggested fixes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time collaboration features, so that I can work with team members during 24-hour build sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple developers join a project THEN the system SHALL provide real-time code synchronization and conflict resolution
2. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL show live cursors and editing indicators for all team members
3. WHEN discussing code THEN the system SHALL provide inline comments and chat functionality
4. WHEN reviewing changes THEN the system SHALL offer built-in code review tools with approval workflows
5. IF conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide merge tools and collaborative resolution interfaces

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing and quality assurance tools, so that I can maintain code quality while moving fast.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL provide real-time linting, formatting, and error detection
2. WHEN generating components THEN the system SHALL automatically create unit tests with reasonable coverage
3. WHEN building features THEN the system SHALL run integration tests and provide feedback on breaking changes
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL run automated accessibility, performance, and security scans
5. IF quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations and automated fixes where possible

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with popular development tools and services, so that I can use my preferred workflow and existing accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting external services THEN the system SHALL support popular databases, authentication providers, and APIs
2. WHEN using version control THEN the system SHALL integrate with GitHub, GitLab, and other Git providers
3. WHEN managing projects THEN the system SHALL sync with project management tools like Linear, Notion, and Jira
4. WHEN monitoring applications THEN the system SHALL connect with analytics, logging, and monitoring services
5. IF integrations fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and manual configuration guides

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want progress tracking and documentation generation, so that I can maintain transparency and share my build journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working on the project THEN the system SHALL automatically track development progress and time spent on different features
2. WHEN reaching milestones THEN the system SHALL generate progress reports with screenshots, code metrics, and feature completion status
3. WHEN building features THEN the system SHALL automatically generate API documentation and component documentation
4. WHEN completing the MVP THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive project summary with architecture diagrams and deployment guides
5. IF sharing the build journey THEN the system SHALL provide blog post templates and social media content based on the development process
